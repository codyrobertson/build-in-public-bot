			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Initialize Project Structure and Package Configuration",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down project initialization into: 1) Package.json setup with bin configuration, 2) TypeScript configuration and build setup, 3) Directory structure creation, 4) Development workflow and npm scripts setup",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity involving multiple configuration files and build processes. Requires understanding of npm packaging, TypeScript compilation, and CLI distribution patterns."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Core CLI Command Structure",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Separate into command implementations: 1) Commander.js framework setup, 2) bip init command, 3) bip post command, 4) bip code command, 5) bip style command, 6) bip history/draft commands with shared error handling",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to multiple distinct commands requiring different argument parsing, validation, and business logic. Each command has unique requirements and error scenarios."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Configuration Management System",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into: 1) Configuration file structure and schema design, 2) Secure credential storage implementation, 3) Configuration validation and defaults, 4) Cross-platform home directory handling, 5) Configuration migration and version management",
			"reasoning": "High complexity involving security considerations, cross-platform compatibility, and data persistence. Credential storage requires platform-specific implementations and encryption."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Twitter Authentication and API Integration",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: 1) Twitter API library integration and evaluation, 2) Authentication flow implementation, 3) Session management and persistence, 4) Rate limiting and error handling, 5) API response processing, 6) Fallback mechanisms and retry logic",
			"reasoning": "Very high complexity due to unofficial API usage, authentication challenges, rate limiting, and the need for robust error handling. Twitter's API changes frequently and requires careful session management."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "AI-Powered Tweet Generation Engine",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into: 1) AI provider integration (OpenAI/Claude), 2) Prompt engineering and template system, 3) Style matching and personalization logic, 4) Character limit handling and optimization, 5) Context understanding and content formatting",
			"reasoning": "High complexity requiring AI integration, prompt engineering expertise, and sophisticated text processing. Balancing creativity with constraints like character limits and style consistency."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Code Screenshot Generation System",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: 1) Carbon API integration and configuration, 2) Language detection and syntax highlighting, 3) Playwright fallback implementation, 4) Image processing and optimization",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity involving external API integration and fallback mechanisms. Requires handling various file formats and programming languages with proper error recovery."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Personal Style Configuration Interface",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Separate into: 1) Interactive CLI prompts and user interface, 2) Style validation and schema definition, 3) Preview generation system, 4) Style persistence and retrieval",
			"reasoning": "Medium complexity focusing on user experience and data validation. Requires interactive CLI design and integration with the AI generation system."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Tweet Posting and Preview System",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: 1) Workflow orchestration and state management, 2) Preview generation and display, 3) User confirmation and interaction handling, 4) Image attachment processing, 5) Error recovery and rollback mechanisms",
			"reasoning": "High complexity as it integrates multiple systems (AI, screenshots, Twitter API) with user interaction. Requires sophisticated error handling and state management."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "History and Draft Management",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into: 1) Data storage design and implementation, 2) History display and formatting, 3) Draft save/load functionality, 4) Search and filtering capabilities",
			"reasoning": "Medium complexity involving data persistence and retrieval. Relatively straightforward compared to API integrations but requires careful data modeling."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Error Handling, Testing, and Documentation",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into: 1) Comprehensive error handling strategy, 2) Unit testing suite implementation, 3) Integration testing with mocked APIs, 4) User documentation and examples, 5) Package publishing preparation",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to the comprehensive nature of testing all integrated systems, creating meaningful error messages, and ensuring publication readiness. Requires testing complex async workflows and API interactions."
